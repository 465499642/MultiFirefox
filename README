contributing patches!

Warning:
========

The source code for MultiFirefox, while functional, is old, and one of my first
attempts at Objective-C. I haven't had any real time to rewrite chunks of it,
so if you have difficulty following it, or find yourself laughing out loud at
the way things were done, just keep that in mind ;)
