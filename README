Warning:
========

The source code for MultiFirefox, while functional,
is old, and one of my first attempts at Objective-C. 
I haven't had any real time to rewrite chuncks of it,
so if you have difficulty following it, or find 
yourself laughing out loud at the way things were 
done, just keep that in mind ;)
